                                     =======

Overview
========

touchwm is a prototype of a window manager for touchscreen devices. It is
intended to be a sandbox for experimenting with user interface concepts in
in this setting.

Requirements
============

touchwm depends on the XCB headers, and particularly on its input extensions.
Note that this may not be provided by default, so xcb may need to be built
from source and configured with --enable-xinput in order to support this.
Ensure that LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH point to the correct places.


Building and Installation
=========================

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
