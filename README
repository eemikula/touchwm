                                     =======

Overview
========

touchwm is a prototype of a window manager for touchscreen devices. It is
intended to be a sandbox for experimenting with user interface concepts in
in this setting.

Requirements
============

touchwm depends on the XCB headers, and particularly on its input extensions.
Note that this may not be provided by default, so xcb may need to be built
from source and configured with --enable-xinput in order to support this.
Ensure that LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH point to the correct places.

Additionally, in order to translate some touch events into mouse events,
touchwm depends on the libsuinput library. Using this library comes with some
setup requirements. Specifically, udev rules need to be configured, and any
users need to be added to the appropriate group. Finally, ensure the uinput
kernel module is loaded correctly.

The easiest way to do this is:

	sudo cp 40-uinput.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
	sudo groupadd uinput
	sudo usermod -a -G uinput `whoami`
	sudo modprobe uinput 

Building and Installation
=========================

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
