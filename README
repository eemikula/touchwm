                                     =======

Overview
========

touchwm is a prototype of a window manager for touchscreen devices. It is
intended to be a sandbox for experimenting with user interface concepts in
in this setting.

Requirements
============

Dependencies include xcb, xcb-xinput, xcb-util, xcb-ewmh, xcb-keysyms,
cairo, and librsvg2. 

xcb-xinput is experimental and not enabled by default, and may need to be
built from source. This can be done by building xcb according to the steps
described at http://xcb.freedesktop.org/DevelopersGuide and specifying the
--enable-xinput option on configure. Additionally, in order to translate some
touch events into mouse events, touchwm depends on the libsuinput library,
which also will likely need to be built from source, instructions for which
can be found at http://tjjr.fi/sw/libsuinput/#download-and-install
Using this library comes with some setup requirements. Specifically, udev
rules need to be configured, and any users need to be added to the appropriate
group. Finally, ensure the uinput kernel module is loaded correctly.

The easiest way to do this is:

	sudo cp 40-uinput.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
	sudo groupadd uinput
	sudo usermod -a -G uinput `whoami`
	sudo modprobe uinput 

Building and Installation
=========================

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
